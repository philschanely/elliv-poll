<h1>Funniest Flashback</h1>
<h2>Stephen Clark and the Chocolate Milk Incident</h2>
<p>I was an innocent freshman working my utility shift at Chuck's on a Saturdaymorning, and part of my job was to replace the milks. I was putting a new bag of 2% milk into the container which have about five gallons of milk which is roughly 35 to 40 pounds. I was looking away and talking to my friends while I was adjusting the nozzle on the bag of milk, and I felt a sudden tug. I looked back and realized I had somehow ripped the nozzle off the bag of milk, which caused the entire 40 pounds of milk to gush out of the container directly onto my pants. I looked around in awkward panic and slowly shut the milk container, and it started dribbling out of the container all over the counter, the floor, my pants, literally everywhere. It was noon on a Saturday so everyone and their mom was in the cafeteria so they all clapped for me, which was nice. A couple guys were sent over to help me clean up and we were squeezing all the spilled milk into a 5 gallon bucket, but then I opened the milk container to clean that out and I knocked the bucket over and spilled all the milk again. When I picked up the mop to clean that up, I accidentally hit a ceiling tile and knocked it out of place and it stayed that way for the rest of the semester. Somewhere along the line, Caleb Peterson took this picture, and then came over and put one single napkin on the gallons of milk on the floor to &quot;help.&quot; We met a year and a half later and he confessed to me that he did that another year afterwards. I finally finished cleaning it all up but still had an hour and a half left to finish of my shift in my milksaturated pants. Then I quit my job.</p>
<h2>Tony Hou and Clayton King</h2>

Before you eat anything else, just pick up the whole thing (I completely lost it)! Open your mouth as wide as you can get it, pop that bad boy in your mouth and just start chewing! (I lose it again)</p>
<p>King: &quot;Wow! Oh Lord Jesus just bless him! Right now!&quot; *soundbite is included, if you’d like, just ask Rae</p>
<h2>Jonathan Gummel Waiting on Permission</h2>
<p>&quot;That One Night: Saunas, Smoke Detectors, and a Seriously Upset R.A.&quot; This is the story of how I tried to shake the Cedarville plague by a 2 am sauna in my Lawlor unit freshmen year. The sauna went great. What followed did not go so great. When the bathroom doors opened, the steam billowed into the hallway and set off the smoke detectors in the unit at 3:30 in the morning. Safe to say, my RA was not happy, I woke up everyone in the unit, and had to have a conversation with the RD.</p>
